check recordings lecture 4 for code

multiple files run with main(.py)

w = weight/willingness --> to far won't go

gc.collect to free memory(don't use too often, slow?)

use folium

sensitivity analysis for assumptions

use mainly elasticsearch


use:
    tic = time.time()

    # Time and print the elapsed time
    toc = time.time()
    elapsed_time = toc - tic
    print('Total running time of GBM: {:.2f} seconds'.format(elapsed_time))
